"""OpenAI agent stack: a language-model reasoning stack behind ReasoningStack.

It runs the reconciliation as a cognitive agent. Given the two lifted semantic
models, it proposes correspondences, deciding by gloss and canonical example
rather than by names, and marks concepts with no counterpart as residual.

Cognition placement is a first-class variable:

* both_cognitive — both sides are live, interrogable agents. Each concept is
  presented in full, and (with the reference) carries its binding.
* one_inert — one side cannot explain itself. Its concepts are presented as label
  and kind only, with no gloss, synonyms, example, or binding. The live agent must
  reconstruct the inert side's meaning. With the reference, it does so by matching
  each inert concept to the reference entry whose definition and example fit, which
  is how a published anchor supplies the meaning the silent side cannot volunteer.

Running the SAME stack with and without the reference, at each placement, and
comparing quality and the effort the model spends, tests H1 and its sharper form:
the reference's benefit should grow as cognition recedes.

Requires `pip install openai` and an `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment. The key
is read only by the OpenAI SDK; this module never logs or transmits it elsewhere.
See SETUP_OPENAI.md.
