"""Verification modes over the seeded verify_hard set.

Three modes, each returning a verdict per proposal — "pass", "fail", or "referred"
(cannot decide at this placement, so refer onward):

  * byte_round_trip — the naive baseline the MAGIC paper warns against. A forward-and-
    reverse translation compared for surface equality; it cannot see meaning, so it passes
    any type-compatible pair, including a wrong one that round-trips. Deterministic.
  * invariant_round_trip — an LLM verifier that judges whether the correspondence preserves
    the semantic invariants, reading the two sides' static records. It catches wrong pairs
    whose records differ in an invariant-relevant way (meaning-visible), but is blind to a
    byte-clean wrong pair whose records are identical. Capability-dependent.
  * virtual_operation — the correctness-by-construction step: exercise the correspondence on
    the graph. For services, a provision-and-read-back against the invariants (the instance
    Oracle); for devices/sections, interrogate an authoritative fact on BOTH sides and
    compare. It catches the byte-clean errors the other modes miss — where a live side is
    available. Its reach falls as cognition recedes (an inert side cannot be interrogated).

Deterministic modes need no model; invariant_round_trip calls one. The oracle reads ground
truth; the LLM sees only the records in the proposal.
