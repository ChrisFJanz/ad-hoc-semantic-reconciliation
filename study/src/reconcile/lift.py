"""The lift, performed by an agent (Brad's point 1).

The study reconciles *lifted* semantic models: each concept carries not only its lexical
surface (label, synonyms) and its schema structure (kind, relations) and data (instances),
but also the semantic explanation layer a cognitive side volunteers about itself - a gloss
and a worked example. In the benchmark cases that explanation layer is a pre-materialised
fixture standing for what a cognitive side produces when it lifts and explains itself.

This module instruments that step directly: given only a side's *data-model surface* - its
labels, synonyms, kinds, relations, and instances, with the explanation layer, the reference
binding, the other model, and the gold all withheld - an agent produces each concept's gloss
and worked example. The result is an agent-lifted model whose explanation layer was generated,
not authored, and is otherwise identical to the fixture. Reconciling over it, and comparing to
the fixture lift, measures whether the lift is agent-performable and whether reconciliation is
invariant to who performed it.

The OpenAI client is injectable for offline testing; nothing here touches the network unless a
real client is used.
