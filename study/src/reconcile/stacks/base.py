"""The reasoning-stack interface.

A stack consumes two lifted semantic models (and, if it uses one, a shared
reference) and returns a Reconciliation: the correspondences it proposes, the
concepts it leaves as residual, and a tally of the mechanical work it did.

This is the seam. The two stacks shipped here are model-agnostic and run with no
model access. A language-model agent stack implements the same `reconcile`
signature and drops in behind it, which is where the cognition placement becomes
a live variable.
