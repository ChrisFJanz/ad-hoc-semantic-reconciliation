"""Two-agent negotiation stack: two separate agents reconcile under real information
asymmetry, instead of one model shown both lifted models.

This is the honest form of the fully-cognitive case. Agent A holds ONLY model A; Agent B
holds ONLY model B. Neither sees the other's concepts except:

  * a public catalogue each agent advertises for its own side, carrying label and kind only
    (the surface, so a false cognate can still be proposed and must be caught by meaning); and
  * what the other agent volunteers in answers to questions (gloss, example, relations).

The two agents alternate turns. On its turn an agent may:
  * answer the other's outstanding questions about its own concepts, from its private model;
  * ask about the other's concepts when it needs their meaning to decide;
  * propose correspondences (my concept <-> one of yours) with a confidence and rationale;
  * ratify or reject proposals the other made about MY concepts (each side is the authority
    on its own side -- this is the bilateral confirmation Part I describes); and
  * mark its own concepts that it believes have no counterpart.

A correspondence is CONFIRMED only when one side proposes it and the owning side ratifies it,
or when both sides propose it independently. That is the closed loop: neither side alone
decides a cross-model correspondence.

Placements:
  * both_cognitive -> the negotiation above.
  * one_inert / both_inert -> there is no partner to negotiate with (a mute side cannot answer
    or ratify), so these delegate to the single-agent OpenAIAgentStack, which reconstructs the
    inert side(s) from structure and instances. Negotiation is a both-live phenomenon by design.

Effort is summed across every agent turn (both sides, all rounds), so the cost of the exchange
is measured, not hidden. Requires `pip install openai` and OPENAI_API_KEY, except with an
injected client (used by the offline test).
